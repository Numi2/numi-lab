# Authoring and compilation

MetalRobo accepts semantic source assets and packs. Only the compiler creates
packed indices, offsets, capacities, execution cohorts, and GPU layouts.

## Inputs

`WorldSource` accepts one of:

- URDF plus optional SRDF and referenced assets;
- MJCF and recursively included assets once the importer is qualified;
- the current persisted WorldPack format.

A simulation also accepts a TaskPack and optional PolicyPack. Sensors are
authored with the world and selected or transformed by TaskPack observation
operators.

## Compiler pipeline

```text
parse with source locations
        -> expand includes and defaults
        -> validate units and semantics
        -> resolve names and provenance
        -> build ModelIR / ActuatorIR / SensorIR
        -> compile constraints and rod domains
        -> compile TaskIR / PolicyIR
        -> derive capacities and execution cohorts
        -> fingerprint artifacts and contracts
        -> publish immutable CompiledSimulation
```

Compilation is transactional. A failed compile returns diagnostics without a
partially usable program.

## Model rules

- SI units are canonical: metres, kilograms, seconds, radians, newtons, and
  newton-metres.
- Body translation and linear velocity refer to centre of mass.
- Floating orientation uses normalized quaternion `xyzw`; angular increments
  and derivatives use tangent coordinates.
- Inertias must be finite, positive, and physically valid after frame
  transformation.
- Collision and visual geometry are independent authored resources.
- Dynamic triangle soups are rejected unless converted to a declared convex
  decomposition.
- Near-zero scalar joint ranges compile as equality constraints; inverted
  ranges fail compilation.
- Every actuator/controller preset has a stable fingerprint. A policy cannot
  mix fields from different presets.

Bundled robots are generated from pinned upstream assets. Their manifest
records source revision, hashes, licenses, conversions, geometry substitutions,
and actuator/controller presets. Application code must not clone or manually
rebase bundled mechanics tables.

## MJCF compatibility target

The importer must preserve order-sensitive MJCF behavior and cascading
defaults/classes before constructing ModelIR. The first qualified surface is:

- recursive includes with cycle detection and asset provenance;
- bodies, frames, sites, inertials, and common geoms;
- hinge, slide, ball, and free joints;
- motors, position/velocity actuators, and general actuator gearing;
- fixed and spatial tendons;
- equality constraints, contact rules, options, sensors, and keyframes.

Flex, plugins, SDFs, fluids, cloth, general deformables, and undecomposed
dynamic concave geometry fail with source-located diagnostics. A pinned
companion MJCF used by a bundled robot is not evidence of a general importer.

## TaskPack

TaskPack compiles into fixed-shape phase tables:

1. action and actuator binding;
2. command and event generation;
3. observation construction;
4. reward calculation;
5. termination and truncation;
6. recording and metrics;
7. transactional reset and curriculum update.

Supported source families include joint/actuator state, arbitrary body or site
pose/twist/acceleration, projected axes, point velocity, Jacobian-derived
quantities, contact groups and wrenches, sensor outputs, and SE(3) goals.
Operators perform transforms, differences, norms, bounds, tolerances, gates,
histories, and weighted reductions.

All names resolve at compilation. The GPU receives only typed indices, ranges,
counts, and fixed output layouts. Actor observations, privileged critic inputs,
and truth-only metrics are distinct bindings.

## Sensor authoring

Each sensor declaration specifies:

- modality and parent frame;
- target or collision filter group;
- dtype, shape, and observation layout;
- sample phase/rate, exposure, latency, and history;
- deterministic noise, bias, dropout, and reset state;
- actor, critic, truth, recorder, and deployment permissions.

Non-divisor rates use deterministic fixed-point phase accumulators. Randomness
is counter-based and keyed by environment, episode, sensor, sample, and
channel. Unobserved and unrecorded sensors are removed by the compiler.

RGB, depth, identities, normals, and motion consume only authored Visual
Presentation V3 packs. Tactile deformation consumes authored undeformed and
sensing surfaces; solver impulses remain the force and wrench authority.

## PolicyPack

PolicyPack binds a typed PolicyIR to exact observation, action, actuator,
history, normalization, recurrent-state, dtype, and reset contracts. Mutable
weights carry a monotonic revision and install only into an inactive native
weight bank. The runtime swaps revisions between rollout chunks.

A mismatch in dimensions, fingerprints, history, reset behavior, or actuator
preset is a compile/install error, never an implicit adapter.

## Fingerprints

Fingerprints appear at artifact, cache, replay, policy-contract, and external
comparison boundaries. They are not computed per frame and are not duplicated
across adjacent metadata without an independent trust boundary.
